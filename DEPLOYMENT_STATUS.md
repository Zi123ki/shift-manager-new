# Deployment Status

Last deployment attempt: 2025-09-15 20:05 PM

## Current Issue:
- Cloudflare Pages is stuck on commit 94f7ae8
- Not pulling latest commit e1ffae5 which has workspace fix
- Still getting EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL workspace error

## Latest Fix (e1ffae5):
✅ Removed workspace configuration from root package.json
✅ Clean build command: `cd apps/web && npm install && npm run build`
✅ Tested locally - build works perfectly
✅ No workspace dependencies in root

## Cloudflare Pages Issue:
- Webhook sync problem between GitHub and Cloudflare
- Need to force recognition of latest commit
- May require manual dashboard configuration

## Manual Solution:
If automatic deployment continues to fail, configure manually in Cloudflare Pages Dashboard:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Build output directory: `apps/web/dist`
- Ensure branch is set to `main` with latest commit
