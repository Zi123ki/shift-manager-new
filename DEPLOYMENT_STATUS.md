## Issues encountered:
- Cloudflare Pages is not pulling latest commits from GitHub
- Still using commit 567ca28 instead of latest ca4429e
- Workspace compatibility issues resolved but deployment stuck

## Solutions implemented:
1. Removed wrangler.toml to avoid parsing errors
2. Updated build command to bypass workspace dependencies
3. Created proper build configuration for Cloudflare Pages

## Next steps:
- Force new deployment trigger
- Verify Cloudflare Pages webhook configuration
- Consider manual deployment if needed
